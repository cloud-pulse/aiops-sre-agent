"""
Strategy manager for model selection using the Strategy pattern.

This module provides a comprehensive strategy management system for selecting
the most appropriate LLM model based on different optimization goals such as
cost, performance, quality, and time-based considerations.

The Strategy pattern is implemented with:
- Abstract base class for strategies
- Concrete strategy implementations
- Strategy manager for selection and management
- Performance tracking and metrics

This module now serves as a coordination layer that imports and re-exports
functionality from the specialized strategy modules:
- strategy_base.py: Base classes and common types
- strategy_implementations.py: Concrete strategy implementations
- strategy_selector.py: Strategy manager and selection logic
- strategy_metrics.py: Performance metrics and monitoring

Classes:
    StrategyManager: Main manager for model selection strategies
    OptimizationGoal: Enum for different optimization goals
    StrategyContext: Context data for strategy execution
    StrategyResult: Result data from strategy execution
    ScoringWeights: Configuration for model scoring weights
    ScoringContext: Context for model scoring operations
    ModelScore: Score data for model evaluation
    ModelSelectionStrategy: Abstract base class for strategies
    CostOptimizedStrategy: Strategy that prioritizes cost efficiency
    PerformanceOptimizedStrategy: Strategy that prioritizes performance
    QualityOptimizedStrategy: Strategy that prioritizes quality
    TimeBasedStrategy: Strategy that adapts based on time of day
    HybridStrategy: Strategy that balances multiple factors with learning
    StrategyMetricsCollector: Collects and analyzes strategy performance metrics
    StrategyPerformanceAnalyzer: Analyzes strategy performance patterns
    StrategyRecommendationEngine: Provides strategy recommendations based on metrics
