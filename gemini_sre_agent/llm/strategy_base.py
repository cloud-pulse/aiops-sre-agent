"""
Strategy base classes and common types for model selection strategies.

This module provides the abstract base class and common types for implementing
the Strategy pattern in model selection. It defines the core interfaces and
data structures used by all strategy implementations.

Classes:
    ModelSelectionStrategy: Abstract base class for model selection strategies
    OptimizationGoal: Enum defining available optimization goals
    StrategyContext: Context data for strategy execution
    StrategyResult: Result data from strategy execution
    ScoringWeights: Configuration for model scoring weights
    ScoringContext: Context for model scoring operations
